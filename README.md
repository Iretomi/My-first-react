# My-first-react
This is a simple website project created using React, showcasing my skills in front-end web development. The website features a heading saying "I Love Yogurt" displayed at the top, along with an image of yogurt placed at the top left, wrapped in a border.

The layout of the website is divided into three sections, with horizontal splitters in the middle and vertical splitters to the right.

The website is built using TypeScript and follows a modular approach with components defined in a separate model.ts file. 
The components include TextTile, ImageTile, ButtonTile, HorizontalSplitter, and VerticalSplitter, which are used to structure the content of the website. The styles for the components are defined in a separate styles.css file, including borders, padding, and spacing to achieve the desired layout.
